# [Investigating Gender Bias in Spotify](https://franciscamoyajimenez.medium.com/todays-top-tip-challenge-gender-bias-within-spotify-s-most-streamed-playlist-ef8c3bb9cc5f)

Using another GitHub Repo storing [Spotify playlist archives](https://github.com/mackorone/spotify-playlist-archive) made by user [Mackorone](https://github.com/mackorone) and WikiData's API, our group investigated gender bias within Today's Top Hits Playlist on Spotify. Our [post on Medium](https://franciscamoyajimenez.medium.com/todays-top-tip-challenge-gender-bias-within-spotify-s-most-streamed-playlist-ef8c3bb9cc5f) summarizes our process and findings. Find links to specific Jupyter notebooks related to our process below. 

**Null hypothesis:** Cisgender male artists represent only half of the artists in Spotify's Today’s Top Hits playlists.

**Alternative hypothesis:** Spotify's Today’s Top Hits playlist contains a gender bias that favors cisgender male artists.

**Our Process:**
